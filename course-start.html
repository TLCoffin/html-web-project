        The first of three information paragraphs this one talks about setting
        in a world building context.
      -->
      <h2>Setting</h2>

      <img
        src="images/planet-with-moon.jpg"
        width="350"
        alt="a planet with a moon orbiting it and 
        rings like saturn shaded nicely had a hand 
        drawn feel with shading in pleasing blobs" />

      <p>
        The setting is one if not the most important part of a good universe it<br />
        is the universe itself. You will have to decide if you want this to be<br />
        in our real universe or an entirely new place with different rules so,<br />
        do you want to start smaller with a solar system, a planet, anything<br />
        find your starting point and well move on from here.<br />
        <br />
      </p>

      <!--
        The second information paragraphs this one talks about physics in a
        world building context.
      -->
      <h2>Physics</h2>

      <img
        src="images/atom.webp"
        width="350"
        alt="a visual depiction of an atom with a 
        fiery looking center and protons that appear 
        to be electrified the background is polygon 
        lines and dots" />

      <p>
        After you have decided where you want everything to take place,<br />
        let's talk about physics! How a universe works is vital to how<br />
        characters act and what they can do. In our universe you are<br />
        pulled to massive things like planets because of gravity, is<br />
        there anything like that in your universe? think about that<br />
        for a minute how do things move here what makes up the space<br />
        that is here are objects made of atoms or molecules? or are<br />
        obects simply there made up of one big peice instead of smaller<br />
        peices?<br />
        <br />
      </p>

      <br />
      <!--
        The third information paragraph this one talks about how to encorporate
        life in a world building context.
      -->
      <h2>Life</h2>

      <img
        src="images/life.jfif"
        width="350"
        alt="a human figure standing before a sunset on 
        a beach the colors of the sunset streak across 
        the sky and reflect across the water" />
      <p>
        Life is what makes a universe and story interesting is spices<br />
        things up and makes them changing and fun, life can be anything<br />
        from micro organisms to complex beings such as animals and in<br />
        our universe humans. What kind of life (if any) resides within<br />
        your space? Who are your characters? What other species live<br />
        in harmony with them? Are there conflicts between species?<br />
        <br />
